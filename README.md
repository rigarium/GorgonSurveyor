# Gorgon-Surveyor
Got tired of clicking through surveys so I made a little program to map them out easily

If there's any interest I'll put up binaries when it's a little more fleshed out. Quick walkthrough of how to build for now:

1: Download Godot 3.0 (as of the time of this writing there's a 3.01 but I'm not sure if it breaks compatibility) from https://godotengine.org/
2: Download or clone this repository, unzip if necessary
3: Run Godot, click "Import" and select the project.godot file you just unzipped or cloned
4: Run the project
5: At the top click "Project" and then "Export"
6: Click "Add" near the top, select your operating system (I only use Windows and haven't tested for other platforms. Can't imagine there's a problem)
7: To come because I can't seem to get the export data downloaded
